## Details
  * I didn't have enough time to finish and validate all completely. Probably if you use the app you'll see some "bugs".
  * [There is a problem with the endpoint], because whe use the app as a local enviroment the app can consume the endpoint, but when when is hosted the app says "No access control origin".

# As a local enviroment
  * Download and clone the repository.
  * Go to root directory.
  * Run in console "npm install"
